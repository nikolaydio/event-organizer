# eventorg

A service that receives and persists incomming events. Users can view all requests dedicated to themselfs.
Communication with the eventorg server can happen with the provided open rest API.

Users would eventually be able to make their own private feeds from different data sources like emails, social networks, production server logs or even their own custom hardware and software.

Hooks or triggers should be presented to let the user add additional behaviour on event hitting the server.

## Usage


    $ java -jar eventorg-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
